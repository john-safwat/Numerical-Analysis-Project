# Numerical Analysis

## Description

This project is a numerical analysis application built using Flutter that can be used to solve matrices and nonlinear equations. It provides implementations of the following methods:

* Gauss method: This method is used to solve systems of linear equations. It works by repeatedly adding multiples of one row to another row in order to eliminate the leading coefficient of a variable in that row.

* Gauss-Jordan method: This method is a more efficient version of the Gauss method. It works by performing row operations to reduce the system of equations to row echelon form.
* Cramer's rule: This rule can be used to solve systems of linear equations with a single unknown. It works by calculating the determinants of the coefficient matrix and the matrices formed by replacing each column of the coefficient matrix with the column of constants.
* Bisection method: This method is a simple iterative method that can be used to find the roots of a function. It works by repeatedly bisecting the interval that contains the root and then choosing the subinterval that is more likely to contain the root.
* False position method: This method is similar to the bisection method, but it uses the most recent guess to improve the accuracy of the next guess.
* Newton's method: This method is a more efficient iterative method that can be used to find the roots of a function. It works by using the derivative of the function to approximate the next guess.
* Secant method: This method is similar to Newton's method, but it does not require the derivative of the function.
* Sample fixed point method: This method is a simple iterative method that can be used to find the fixed points of a function. A fixed point of a function is a point where the function equals itself.

The project also includes a graphical user interface (GUI) that makes it easy to use the methods. The GUI allows the user to enter the matrices and equations, and then it displays the results of the calculations.

This project is a useful tool for students and engineers who need to solve matrices and nonlinear equations. It is also a good example of how to use Flutter to build numerical analysis applications.

Here are some additional features that could be added to this project:

* Support for more complex matrix operations, such as matrix multiplication and inversion.
* Support for more nonlinear equations, such as exponential and trigonometric equations.
* A more sophisticated GUI that allows the user to customize the calculations.
* The ability to save and load the results of the calculations.
